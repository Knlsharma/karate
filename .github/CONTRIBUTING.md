# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from everybody, including bug fixes, new features, improvements on the documentation, and general suggestions.:smile:

Here are some pieces of advice and suggestions

   - We recommend to discuss changes and contributions in a Github issue.
   - Check in the current Github issues to see if a similar issue is already discussed, and join efforts.
   - Make the updates as small and contained as possible, possibly under different Github commits, to facilitate the code review. Don't      hesitate to use the Github code review.
   - Follow the coding style used in the package.
   - If possible try to add a unit test that checks the new code.
   - If a relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and make sure that the admins are okay with your approach.
   - If no relevant issue exists, steps to [submit an issue](https://github.com/intuit/karate/wiki/How-to-Submit-an-Issue) and discuss.

     **Note:** Please proceed with a Pull Request only after the project admins or owners are okay with your approach. It'd be sad if your Pull Request (and your hard work) isn't accepted just because it isn't ideologically compatible.
